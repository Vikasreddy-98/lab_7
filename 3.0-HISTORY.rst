3.0.0 (2015-xx-xx)

- Remove the ``__bool__`` and ``__nonzero__`` methods from a ``Response``
  object.

  This has been a planned feature for over a year. The behaviour is surprising
  to most people and breaks most of the assumptions that people have about
  Response objects. This resolves issue `#2002`_

- Skip over empty chunks in iterators. Empty chunks could prematurely signal 
  the end of a request body's transmission, skipping them allows all of the 
  data through. See `#2631`_ for more details.
